**Error!** I am not native English speaker, so expect *grammar* errors~~~

Super Heated Stone MOD a simple Minecraft MOD created by me and hokomili. It supports Minecraft 1.11.2.

## What can this do?

This mod allows you to smelt stone into lava. Because lava is so **<span style='color:red;'>HOT</span>**, you need to smelt many times to do this.

## Recipes

Just smelt, smelt, and smelt, you can turn stone into <span style='color:orange;'>magma block</span>. Next, you need our [Strange Recipe MOD](https://github.com/stdio2016/STRecipe) to convert magma to lava.
